description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collaboration with the Lakeland Police Department, I was assigned the responsibility of designing a custom bracket to facilitate the seamless integration of their Axon Signal Side Arm modules with the recently procured Alien Gear Rapid Force Duty Holsters. The department required a dependable mounting solution to enable the utilization of these holsters in the forthcoming autumn season. In the absence of an existing remedy, I eagerly accepted this task."
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I initiated a comprehensive design process, commencing with an in-depth client consultation to grasp their requirements and vision. Armed with valuable insights, I developed initial prototypes, subjecting them to client feedback and refinement. Throughout the iterative design process, I meticulously refined the bracket's specifications to optimize functionality and ensure compatibility with both the Axon Signal Side Arm modules and Alien Gear Rapid Force Duty Holsters.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon finalizing the design, I prepared a detailed quote aligned with the Lakeland Police Department's budget and expectations. Recognizing the innovation and uniqueness of the mounting solution, I pursued legal protection for my invention. Collaborating with the esteemed Florida Polytechnic legal team, I secured a provisional patent.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With necessary legal safeguards in place, I proceeded to upscale production with precision and rigorous quality assurance. I successfully manufactured 350 bespoke mounts, satisfying the demands of the entire Lakeland Police Department.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project not only achieved its primary objective of delivering a customized mounting solution but also highlighted my ability to collaborate with clients, navigate legal complexities, and deliver tangible results. Contributing to the safety and efficiency of law enforcement personnel through this innovative product has been an immensely rewarding experience."
