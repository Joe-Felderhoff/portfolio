client: Lakeland Police Department
category: Design and Production
description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collaboration with the Lakeland Police Department, I was assigned the responsibility of designing a custom bracket to facilitate the integration of their Axon Signal Side Arm modules with the recently purchased Alien Gear Rapid Force Duty Holsters. The department required a dependable mounting solution to enable the utilization of these holsters in the Fall. "
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I initiated a comprehensive design process, commencing with an in-depth client consultation to grasp their requirements and vision. With insights, I developed initial prototypes, subjecting them to client feedback and refinement. Throughout the iterative design process, I refined the bracket's specifications to optimize functionality and ensure compatibility with both the Axon Signal Side Arm modules and Alien Gear Rapid Force Duty Holsters.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon finalizing the design, I prepared a detailed quote aligned with the Lakeland Police Department's budget and expectations. Since the part was for firearms and also had the ability to make money, I worked with Florida Poly's legal team to get a provisonal patent for my design and get liability handled.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After LPD was happy, I proceeded to upscale production and successfully manufactured 350 mounts, completing the request of the Lakeland Police Department.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project not only achieved its primary objective of delivering a mounting solution but also highlighted my ability to collaborate with clients, navigate legal complexities, and deliver tangible results. Contributing to the safety and efficiency of law enforcement personnel through this innovative product has been an immensely rewarding experience."
