description: I was tasked with creating a payload release device for the NASA Microgravity Study Capstone project. I communicated with the drone rental company, the drone manufacturer, and other colleges participating in the completion to create a device that fits everyone's needs. 
outcome: I learned how to use a radio control remote and reviser to toggle parabolic release switches and successfully dropped all payloads without issue. The device worked so well; it will continue to be used for the following years.
