description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, titled <q>Interplanetary Mission Design using Hohmann Transfer,<q> I collaborated with a fellow student, Sydney Wickett, to explore the fascinating realm of orbital mechanics. Our goal was to design an interplanetary mission from Earth to Jupiter, employing the energy-efficient Hohmann transfer method. The project was conducted as part of the Orbital Mechanics course (EAS 4505) under the guidance of Dr. Sanna Siddiqui at Florida Polytechnic University.
<br><br>
The Project Objectives were as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Design a Hohmann transfer mission to travel from Earth to Jupiter, taking into account the required velocity increments for departure, trajectory, and arrival.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Calculate essential orbital elements to define the initial Earth orbit, such as specific angular momentum, inclination angle, eccentricity, and true anomaly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Determine the defining parameters of the Hohmann transfer ellipse, including semi-major axis, orbital period, and eccentricity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Analyze mission progression characteristics, such as initial and final phase angles between Earth and Jupiter, synodic period, and minimum wait time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Compare different propellant types to select the most efficient one for the interplanetary mission."
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We employed MATLAB to conduct the necessary calculations and simulations. The project involved five main sections, each addressing specific aspects of the interplanetary mission. These sections included computing orbital elements for the initial Earth orbit, calculating the total velocity increment for the Hohmann transfer, defining parameters of the Hohmann transfer ellipse, analyzing mission progression characteristics, and selecting the optimal propellant type.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our rigorous calculations and simulations, we successfully designed an efficient interplanetary mission from Earth to Jupiter. The project provided valuable insights into orbital mechanics and celestial mechanics, understanding the intricacies of Hohmann transfers and interplanetary travel.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project not only enhanced our theoretical understanding of orbital mechanics but also strengthened our practical skills in MATLAB programming. The results demonstrate our ability to plan and analyze complex interplanetary missions while considering crucial factors such as fuel efficiency and time constraints."
