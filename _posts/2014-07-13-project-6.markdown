description: I used ODE45 and MATLAB to simulate an inverted pendulum and cart kinematic system. I then created a PID function to stabilize the cart to inputted forces and tuned the values for the best response using the Zieglerâ€“Nichols Tuning method.
outcome: I learned how to use the ODE45 function in MATLAB and got familiar with creating PID functions and tuning them.
