description: Entire drive-by-wire conversion of an electric golf cart using a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino.
outcome: I learned Python and got familiar with libraries such as PySimpleGUI to create the touchscreen interface and PyGame, which is how I interfaced with the Xbox remote. An Arduino Nano was used to operate the stepper, allowing for better control of the step pulses and easy integration for the absolute encoder. Timers and interrupts protocols were used to ensure the stepper constantly targeted the right angle. This project also gave me a substantial amount of wiring and circuit experience since I needed to incorporate pneumatics and other sensors. Three control modes exist; a manual mode which makes the golf cart work like normal; an Xbox mode which allows the user to control all functions of the cart with an Xbox One remote; and a Serial mode, which enables the user to run more computationally intensive algorithms on their laptop or PC and send the commands to the Pi. Common failure modes were considered, so the system will stop if the cart doesn't receive new commands for more than .1 seconds. These protections ensure that the cart will cease movement if the remote or serial device is disconnected abruptly. During the project, I worked with professors, grad students, and fabrication specialists.
