description: Entire drive-by-wire conversion of an electric golf cart using a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino for Self-Driving Vehicles Research.
outcome: "As part of my Self-Driving Vehicles Research project, I successfully completed an entire drive-by-wire conversion of an electric golf cart utilizing a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino. This project provided me with a valuable opportunity to learn and apply Python programming, where I became proficient in using essential libraries such as PySimpleGUI for developing the touchscreen interface and PyGame for interfacing with the Xbox remote.
<br>
<pre>To achieve precise control and smooth operation, I integrated an Arduino Nano to control the stepper, which allowed for better management of step pulses and seamless integration with the absolute encoder. Leveraging timers and interrupts protocols, I ensured that the stepper consistently maintained the correct angle for optimized performance.
<br>
<pre>Throughout the project, I gained extensive experience in wiring and circuitry as I incorporated various components, including pneumatics and other sensors. The final result yielded three distinct control modes. The manual mode allowed the golf cart to function conventionally, while the Xbox mode empowered users to control all aspects of the cart using an Xbox One remote. Additionally, I implemented a Serial mode that enabled users to run computationally intensive algorithms on their laptop or PC and transmit commands to the Raspberry Pi.
<br>
<pre>To ensure safety and reliability, I incorporated fail-safe mechanisms that automatically halt cart movement if new commands are not received within 0.1 seconds. This precautionary measure guarantees that abrupt disconnections of the remote or serial device do not lead to potential hazards.
<br>
<pre>Throughout the course of this project, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professors, graduate students, and fabrication specialists. The experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into working effectively within a team and navigating complex research-oriented projects.
<br>
<pre>Overall, this drive-by-wire conversion project for the electric golf cart showcases my proficiency in Python programming, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino integration, as well as my ability to tackle multifaceted challenges and implement practical solutions in the realm of self-driving vehicles research."
