description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entire drive-by-wire conversion of an electric golf cart using a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino for Self-Driving Vehicles Research."
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of my Self-Driving Vehicles Research initiative, I successfully executed a comprehensive drive-by-wire conversion on an electric golf cart, employing a Raspberry Pi and Arduino platform. This endeavor afforded me the opportunity to acquire and apply advanced Python programming skills, specializing in key libraries such as PySimpleGUI for the development of the touchscreen interface and PyGame for interfacing with the Xbox remote.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve precise control and seamless operation, I seamlessly integrated an Arduino Nano to govern the stepper motor, thereby enhancing step pulse management and ensuring seamless synchronization with the absolute encoder. Employing timer and interrupt protocols, I consistently maintained the stepper motor at the correct angle to optimize performance.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of the project, I accumulated substantial expertise in electrical wiring and circuitry while integrating a variety of components, including pneumatics and sensors. The project's culmination resulted in three distinct control modes: a manual mode for conventional operation, an Xbox mode for comprehensive control via an Xbox One remote, and a Serial mode enabling users to execute computationally intensive algorithms on their laptop or PC while transmitting commands to the Raspberry Pi.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure safety and reliability, I incorporated fail-safe mechanisms that automatically halt cart movement if new commands are not received within 0.1 seconds. This precautionary measure guarantees that abrupt disconnections of the remote or serial device do not lead to potential hazards.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the course of this project, I had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professors, graduate students, and fabrication specialists. The experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into working effectively within a team and navigating complex research-oriented projects.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this drive-by-wire conversion project for the electric golf cart showcases my proficiency in Python programming, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino integration, as well as my ability to tackle multifaceted challenges and implement practical solutions in the realm of self-driving vehicles research."
