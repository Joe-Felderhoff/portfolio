description: Students would email me at weird hours and while I was in class to pick up prints, so one day, while I was picking up packages from an Amazon Locker, I realized I could make my own small-scale version of it for students to be able to get their prints at said weird hours. I quickly created a single-cell prototype before pitching the idea to my boss for more funding (acrylic is surprisingly expensive). After funding was secured, I spent a couple of weeks designing a 16-cell version in Solidworks and got everything finalized and validated. The final design has five 100x200 mm cells, nine 200x200 mm cells (the prototyped size), and two 100x300 mm cells for dropping off filament or long prints. 
outcome: I got to design and use compliant 3D printed components for the latches; this was the largest SolidWorks assembly I have created (Approx. 230 components); I learned how to use EEPROM memory on Arduino to allow for the system to remember the cell object states after a power outage, and I solved a problem with a robust and helpful product that will be around long after my graduation.
