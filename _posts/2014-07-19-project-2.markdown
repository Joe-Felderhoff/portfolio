description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our Mechanical Lab Design class, my team worked on a group project with the aim of developing a cost-effective mechanical property tester for laboratory use. Our specific focus was on creating a torsion tester capable of determining the sheer modulus and ultimate stress of 3D-printed samples. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibilities were distributed among the team members: Sydney Wickett handled documentation and post-data processing, Zach Kaiser was in charge of the gear assembly, while I took on the tasks of designing the structure, wiring, writing the Arduino Script, and managing MATLAB serial handling, due to my prior experience."
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our collaborative efforts yielded great results, surpassing project performance metrics while adhering to a budget of less than $100, following NASA's established project methodology. We successfully designed, produced, and comprehensively documented our innovative mechanical property tester.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a personal perspective, this project provided valuable growth opportunities. I refined my scripting skills for managing multiple sensors efficiently and gained hands-on experience in MATLAB for serial port handling, data reading, and storage. Furthermore, the project allowed me to explore and implement diverse fabrication techniques, such as incorporating 2020 aluminum extrusion, acrylic, and 3D printing into the design.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During testing, our product demonstrated exceptional performance, even under rigorous experiments with aluminum samples. Feedback from other teams corroborated the reliability and user-friendliness of our mechanical property tester, as they encountered no issues while conducting experiments.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, this project not only showcased my technical expertise but also highlighted my effective collaboration skills within a team. This experience significantly enriched my skill set and further fueled my passion for mechanical engineering and product development."
