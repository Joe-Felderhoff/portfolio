description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collaboration with the Florida Polytechnic University Police Department, I undertook the responsibility of enhancing their radar speed signage system to address the issue of speeding. The existing system, which relied on flashing yellow lights, had demonstrated inadequacy in mitigating speeding incidents. Our engineering challenge encompassed the integration of a flashing blue light from a decommissioned police vehicle into the system, with the aim of evaluating its potential to enhance road safety."

outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the course of a couple weeks, I was able to research, design, prototype, test, and finalize the system. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final design uses two light sensors, a 12v relay, and an Arduino Nano for the logic. Basically, the light sensors monitor the test LEDs on the back of the panel and when they start to blink at 2 hz it knows the sign is flashing and therefore someone is speeding. This logic activates the blue LED.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of reliability, there are two light sensors for redundancy and every hour a new low threshold is evaluated since ambient light can change within the sign. There is a timing relay that will reset the board if the LED is ever on for more than 30 seconds. The boards are all covered in a conformal coating to mitigate water. Also, the boards only connect to the battery through fused connections so a fatal error of my system will not damage the sign. The frame of the system was 3D printed using ASA so it will not degrade or warp over time. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this was a fun and rewarding project that I get to see in action every day I come to work/school."
