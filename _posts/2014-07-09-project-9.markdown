description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collaboration with the Florida Polytechnic University Police Department, I undertook the responsibility of enhancing their radar speed signage system to address the issue of speeding effectively. The existing system, which relied on flashing yellow lights, had demonstrated inadequacy in mitigating speeding incidents. Our engineering challenge encompassed the integration of a flashing blue light from a decommissioned police vehicle into the system, with the aim of evaluating its potential to enhance road safety."

outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a highly constrained timeframe of just five days, I successfully executed the project, culminating in the delivery of an operational and efficient solution. The initial day was dedicated to comprehending the radar speed sign's functionality and devising a reliable strategy to achieve the desired flashing effect. We explored multiple avenues, aiming to identify a suitable signal wire for seamless integration, albeit regrettably, none proved straightforward.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, a rigorous evaluation of diverse methodologies was conducted on the following day, encompassing considerations such as current detection, serial data interfacing, and the deployment of light as a signaling mechanism. After meticulous analysis, the light-based approach emerged as the most pragmatic choice, offering resilience against potential sign malfunctions resulting from ammeter failures. The infeasibility of utilizing serial data, due to insufficient documentation, further affirmed our decision.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the chosen approach firmly established, the ensuing day was dedicated to the design and assembly of a bespoke circuit. This circuit integrated two light sensors for redundancy, an Arduino Nano, and a removable 12V relay, facilitating the seamless operation of the flashing blue light. Additionally, a mount crafted from ASA was designed and 3D printed to securely house all components, ensuring durability in the sweltering Florida climate. Subsequent efforts focused on code development and exhaustive testing to guarantee flawless functionality.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This undertaking offered a wealth of practical experience in mechatronics, encapsulating the entirety of the product development lifecycle within a condensed timeframe. Moreover, it provided valuable insights into preempting potential failure modes and implementing mitigative measures to construct a dependable system. Throughout the project, meticulous component selection was undertaken, taking into account the project's temporal constraints, ultimately resulting in the delivery of an efficacious solution.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, this endeavor not only showcased my technical proficiency and adept problem-solving capabilities but also demonstrated my capacity to excel under pressure and meet stringent deadlines. Collaborating closely with the Florida Poly Police department afforded me the opportunity to contribute to a noble cause by bolstering road safety and promoting responsible driving behavior."
