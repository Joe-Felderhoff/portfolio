description: I used additive manufacturing to create fractured turtle shells from a 3D scan of an intact shell. The shells were used as part of a class teaching people how to repair damaged shells giving the turtles a chance to recover and thrive.
outcome: Printed 30 shells in a week, got to work with large polygon count 3D scans, and helped teach people how to repair damaged turtle shells.
