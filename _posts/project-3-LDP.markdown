description: I created a bracket for Lakeland Police Department that allows them to attach their Axon Signal Sidearm modules to their Alien Gear Duty Holsters. Currently, hold a Provisional Patent.
outcome: I got to see what being an engineer in the real world is like communicating ideas and testing designs, the legal process of working with lawyers for liability and obtaining a Provisional Patent.
