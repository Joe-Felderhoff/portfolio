description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, I successfully implemented a simulation of an inverted pendulum and cart kinematic system using MATLAB's ODE45 solver. Additionally, I designed and implemented a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control function to stabilize the cart in response to user-inputted forces. To achieve the most efficient and effective performance, I utilized the Ziegler-Nichols Tuning method to fine-tune the PID controller's parameters."
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this project, I gained valuable expertise in utilizing the ODE45 function in MATLAB to simulate complex dynamic systems. Moreover, I developed a strong understanding of PID control principles and how to create custom PID functions to stabilize and control a system. The process of tuning the PID parameters using the Ziegler-Nichols method provided me with crucial insights into achieving optimal system response. This project not only expanded my proficiency in MATLAB but also enhanced my capabilities in control systems and system simulation, laying a solid foundation for tackling more challenging projects in the field of control engineering."
