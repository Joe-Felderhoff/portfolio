description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my involvement in the NASA Microgravity Study Capstone project, I assumed the responsibility of engineering an advanced payload release system. My core task encompassed the design and implementation of a precision mechanism capable of remotely discharging payloads from an aerial drone positioned at an altitude of 500 feet.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the project's duration, I engaged in extensive collaboration with the drone rental service, the drone manufacturer, and the teams of other universities. The primary objective of this collaborative effort was to ascertain that the developed device effectively addressed the multifaceted demands and specifications of all parties participating in the competition."
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the project, I acquired valuable expertise in managing radio control remotes and receivers, which played a pivotal role in ensuring the operation of the payload release mechanism. My extensive testing and refinement led to the flawless execution of the parabolic release switches, enabling precise payload drops from the drone.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device's outstanding performance was evident as it consistently released payloads without any hitches, proving its reliability and effectiveness. My boss (Dr. Bohm) recognized its success, and we chose to keep it for following years rather than scraping the design.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project not only expanded my technical ability but also honed my ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with diverse teams. Contributing to the NASA Microgravity Study Capstone project was a rewarding experience, and I eagerly await future opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge."
